# Diabetes Detection Using XGBoost

This project is designed to predict diabetes using machine learning. The model is built using the XGBoost algorithm to analyze patient data and provide a prediction for diabetes diagnosis.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akash1723/diabetes-detection-xgboost.git
cd model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will load the model and make predictions based on the input data file.

## Features

- Diabetes prediction using patient data
- Trained using XGBoost for classification
- Includes data preprocessing and model evaluation
- Generates classification reports and confusion matrix heatmaps
